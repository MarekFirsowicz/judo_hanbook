The legs are spread wide and positioned in a way to stabilize and maximize control, minimizing the opponent's ability to escape. The practitioner\u2019s weight is distributed across the opponent\u2019s chest to keep them immobilized.

During this maneuver, Tori scissored one of Uke's arms, which is positioned on the side of Tori's chest, securing it tightly against his own body to disable its use. To increase the effectiveness of the hold, Tori brings his face close to Uke's, using his upper body weight to firmly pin Uke to the ground. To maintain balance and counter any attempts by Uke to move or escape, Tori extends one leg forward and places his other leg with the knee flexed beneath him. If Uke attempts to unbalance Tori by pulling from below, Tori can adjust by releasing his hold on Uke's neck and placing that hand on the floor, using it for additional balance and support.",

        descr: "Kuzure Kesa Gatame, often referred to as a modified scarf hold, is a ground control technique used in judo. This technique is a variation of the basic Kesa Gatame (scarf hold) and is effective in both judo competition and self-defense scenarios. In Kuzure Kesa Gatame, the practitioner controls an opponent by positioning themselves perpendicular to the opponent's torso. The key difference from the basic scarf hold is the placement of the arms: one arm wraps around the opponent’s neck with the hand controlling the opponent's far arm, while the other arm secures the opponent's near arm or applies pressure under the opponent’s nearest armpit. This position provides superior control and makes it difficult for the opponent to escape. The practitioner uses their weight advantageously by leaning into the opponent and often positioning their legs wide apart for better stability. This hold is not only a method for immobilizing an opponent but also serves as a platform to execute further techniques such as arm locks or transitions to more dominant positions.",

The practitioner lies across the opponent's chest, facing them, typically with one arm under the opponent\u2019s neck and the other controlling the opponent\u2019s arm, drawing it across their body. The hold is secured by the practitioner pressing their chest against the opponent\u2019s side to restrict movement and breathing.\n\nThis position allows the practitioner to use their body weight advantageously, making it difficult for the opponent to escape by rolling or bridging. Mune-Gatame is less common in competitive judo than other holds due to the greater reliance on upper body strength and the potential for the opponent to leverage a reversal. However, when applied correctly, it can effectively immobilize the opponent, leading to successful pins in match situations.",

            "Positioning for Leverage": "Tori then runs his other arm beneath Uke’s armpit, scooping up Uke's arm, and positions it behind Uke's head to clasp the arm that is already around Uke's neck. This configuration looks like a single raised wing, which is where the technique gets its name.",
            "Enhancing the Strangle": "Tori tightens the strangle hold by using the arm behind Uke’s head to pull on the arm around Uke’s neck. Additionally, Tori can use the forearm of the behind-the-head arm to push Uke's head forward, increasing the pressure on Uke’s windpipe.",
            "Counteracting Escape Attempts": "If Uke is destabilized and topples to one side, Tori maintains the strangle hold's efficacy by using both legs to hold Uke snugly against him. Should Uke attempt to escape by pulling his trapped arm down to capture Tori's arm in his armpit, Tori can counter by planting both feet firmly on the floor and bending his head back to apply more pressure. Moreover, if Uke tries to escape from beneath by pulling on Tori's sleeves, the positioning of Tori’s arms and body alignment restricts these movements effectively."
